## About me
Hi, I'm Shay! I have worked in marketing analytics and this experience made me interested in exploring a career in business analytics/data analytics.

I've recently furthered my education in business and data science in Vancouver.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in data analytics-related topics.

# Shay Nezaki - Data Analytics Portfolio
## About me
Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Shay.

My experience in marketing analytics made me interested in exploring a career in business analytics/data analytics.

I've recently furthered my education in business and data analytics in Vancouver.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in data analytics-related topics.
